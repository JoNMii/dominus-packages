Villages give you resources.  They produce resources from the 6 surrounding hexes every {{date_duration_humanize incomeInterval}}.

You can build up to {{maxVillages}} villages at one time.

Building a village costs {{sVillages.cost.level1.grain}} of each resource and takes {{date_duration_humanize sVillages.cost.level1.timeToBuild}} to build.  Level 1 villages can hire only archers.  They can be upgraded to produce more types of soldiers.

Upgrading a village to level 2 costs {{sVillages.cost.level2.grain}} of each resource and takes {{date_duration_humanize sVillages.cost.level2.timeToBuild}}.  Level 2 villages can hire footmen, archers and pikemen.

Upgrading a village to level 3 costs {{sVillages.cost.level3.grain}} of each resource and takes {{date_duration_humanize sVillages.cost.level3.timeToBuild}}.  Level 3 villages can hire soldiers of any type.

While upgrading, villages do not receive resources and cannot hire soldiers.

Villages have a {{sVillages.defense_bonus}}x defense bonus.

If an army of yours is stopped on the same hex as your village then they will join the village's garrison.
