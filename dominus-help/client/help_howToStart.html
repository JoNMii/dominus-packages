Dominus is a slow strategy game that does not require a lot of time to play.  Give your armies their orders then come back in a few hours to check on them.

Games last anywhere from a day to a month.  When someone wins, the game ends and everyone can start a new game from scratch.

### Build a Village

When you start playing you should focus on building up your income.  The best way to do that in the early game is to build villages. A village collects resources from the ring of hexes surrounding it.

Villages are built using armies.

* Find a good hex to build your village at.  You can only build villages on grain hexes, those are the light green ones.  Find a grain hex near your castle that is surrounded by hexes other than grain.

* Click on your castle.

* Click the "Create Army" button.

* Move one or more sliders to the right and click "Create Army".  Cavalry are best for this task.

* Click "Move Army" and click on the hex where you want to build your village.

When your army reaches their destination they will have a "Build Village" button which you can click on to build your village.

JohnnyZero made a [tutorial video about village placement](https://youtu.be/nsu2l0xxJn4).

### Next Steps

Continue building viillages to gain more income.  You can have up to {{max_can_have}} villages at one time.

Hire soldiers to protect your castle and villages.

After you have an army try attacking a capital or someone's castle.
