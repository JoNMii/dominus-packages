### Contributing

You're already contributing by playing but here are a few other ways you can help.

##### Spread the Word

It's very hard to find new players without paying for ads.  There's a graph in the graph panel showing number of people playing.  Help make it grow. Please tweet, like, star, review Dominus and tell your friends.

##### Money

Dominus' only income is through the store, pro accounts and ads.  Help Dominus grow by buying cosmetic upgrades or donating money through the store panel.

### Strategy

* When you gain a vassal it's usually a good idea to place an army on their castle to prevent an enemy from stealing your vassal.
* It's not always a bad thing if someone takes your castle.  Having a lord gives you protection, an ally and they can send you soldiers/gold.
* Always combine your armies when in battle.  Each army in a battle takes losses.  Having two armies in a battle will cause you to lose twice as many soldiers.

### Performance

Performance can be improved by closing panels and groups.

* In the summary panel minimize the armies, lords and vassals groups.  To do this click on the blue heading.
* Closing panels.
* Hiding the minimap in the settings.
* Having less hexes on screen at once by making your browser window smaller or zooming in.

### UI Tips

* Ctrl + Shift + Mousewheel zooms in and out.
* Change the size of the UI by using browser zoom.  Ctrl+mousewheel in chrome.
