When someone becomes the Dominus a {{date_duration_humanize dominusTime}} countdown starts.  If nobody else becomes the Dominus before the countdown ends then the last person who was the Dominus wins the game.  If someone new becomes the Dominus then the {{date_duration_humanize dominusTime}} countdown is restarted.

The current countdown is seen in a panel in the top right of the screen.

While you are the Dominus your armies are able to attack anyone else's armies but you cannot attack their villages or castles.

After someone wins the game will end and everything will be deleted after a few days.  You can start a new game using the "Game List" link in the top left corner.
