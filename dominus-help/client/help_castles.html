Your castle is the center of your kingdom.  Everyone has one castle and they cannot be destroyed.

Castles are very defensive.  They have a {{sCastles.defense_bonus}}x defense bonus.

If you attack someone's castle and win then you become their lord and they become your vassal.

If your army stops on the same hex as your castle then they will join your castle's garrison.

Castles produce {{collected.gold}} gold,  {{collected.grain}} of each resource and collect vassal income every {{date_duration_humanize incomeInterval}}.
