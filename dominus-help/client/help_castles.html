Your castle is the center of your kingdom.  It is where you hire soldiers.

Castles are very defensive.  They have a {{sCastles.defense_bonus}}x defense bonus.

If you attack someone's castle and win then you become their lord and they become your vassal.

If your army stops on the same hex as your castle then they will join your castle's garrison.
