Capitals are another way to gain income.

The map is divided into countries.  Each country has one capital.  To capture a country send an army to its capital building.  If there is an army there then they will battle.  If you win you will become the ruler of that country.

Unlike other hexes any army on a capital building will battle any other army even if they are allies.

If you are ruler of a country then you get {{floatToPercentage _s.capitals.villagePercentageIncome}}% of each village's income in that country and {{income.grain}} of each resource every {{date_duration_humanize incomeInterval}}.

Capital buildings give {{_s.capitals.battleBonus}}x location bonus to their ruler's armies.
