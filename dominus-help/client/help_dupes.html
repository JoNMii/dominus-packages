Duplicate accounts are not allowed.

Email verification is required when someone creates an account with a password (not for Google or Facebook logins).  Players who haven't verified their email will not receive income.  The castle's info panel shows if a player hasn't yet verified their email.  This is visible to everyone.

Gold transfers and buying soldiers for vassals are public.  Everyone can see alerts for these in the global alerts panel.

If you suspect someone as having a duplicate account please report them.

If someone is actively playing more than one account then both accounts will probably be deleted.

If you wish to start another account please first delete your current account.

To delete your account click the "Delete Account" button in the settings.
