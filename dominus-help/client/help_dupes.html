Duplicate accounts are not allowed.

Email verification is required to join a game when someone creates an account with a password (not for Google or Facebook logins).

Gold transfers and buying soldiers for vassals are public.  Everyone can see alerts for these in the global alerts panel.

If you suspect someone as having a duplicate account please report them.

If you wish to start another account please first delete your current account.

To delete your account open the settings panel by clicking on the wrench to the left side of your screen.  Then click the "Delete Account" button in the settings panel.
