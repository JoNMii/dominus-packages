Duplicate accounts are not allowed.  If you wish to start another account please first delete your current account.

To delete your account in a single game open the settings panel by clicking on the wrench to the left side of your screen.  Then click the "Delete Account" button in the settings panel.

To delete your entire account in all games click on "Settings" to the top right of your screen. 

Email verification is required to join a game when someone creates an account with a password (not for Google or Facebook logins).
